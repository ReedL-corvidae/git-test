        <h1>All about me!</h1>
        <p>My name is Reed and I have 3 cats alongside 1 gecko. I recently graduated from Exeter West Greenwich Regional High School and have had an interest in coding and design since I was 10. In my free time I typically draw, animate or play video games! Im unsure of how I'd describe myself, though I've had friends describe me as both patient and yet "evil", as per their words. I'm excited to see all I can learn in NEIT, I've already learned quite a bit.</p>
